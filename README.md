# NASA Wallpapers
MacOS script to fetch NASA's [Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html) and set it as a wallpaper. It can be used to **automagically fetch a new wallpaper each day ðŸª„âœ¨**

## Linux? Windows?
This script can be easly repurposed for other operating systems. For POSIX systems you just need to replace the `osascript` part for the os specific equivalent. For Windows you can try Windows Subsystem for Linux.

## Script

```zsh
sleep 10 && curl $(echo "https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/$(curl https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html | grep -m 1 "png\|jpg\|jpeg" | awk -F '"' '{print $2}')") > /tmp/new-wallpaper && osascript -e 'tell application "Finder" to set desktop picture to POSIX file "/tmp/new-wallpaper"' && sleep 3 && rm -rf /tmp/new-wallpaper
```
**This script:**

1. Waits 10 seconds (important if it's used at booting Mac. You don't want to do it instantly, before (more important) macOS services are fully working)
2. Goes into https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html website and downloads the HTML code of the main site.
3. Scanns the code for the first assurance of the PNG/JPG/JPEG files and glues together URL for that image
4. Downloads the image into /tmp folder (system's temporary folder)
5. Uses Osascript to set up the background image. This step requires permissions to control computer. Osascript is an Apple scripting language to control UI Applications by commands, and can be easily abused. Always verify osascripts you are executing. Fortunately this part of the script almost read as English so you can really easily verify it :)
6. Waits 3 seconds so that macOS has time to setup the background.
7. Delete the image from /tmp folder. No need to keep it, you will get a new one at reboot :)

## How to make it run on each boot
